# JavaScript for journalists

JavaScript is a particularly useful language for you to learn if you want to either automate some element of presentation, or introduce any sort of interactivity. Examples of JavaScript being used in journalism might include:

* Data visualisation and mapping
* Automatically updating a table of information on a page (for example by pulling from a feed)
* Showing information to a user based on information they input (for example by querying an API)
* Creating quizzes which store the user's answers and calculate a score or result
* Creating calculators which tell the user something based on an input (for example their age, or earnings)
* Creating visual effects when the user scrolls down: for example elements fading in and out or playing automatically (the New York Times' seminal longform piece Snowfall is a good example of this)
* Any combination of the above: for example a quiz might perform a calculation, connect to an API at the end and visualise the results with some fancy fading effects!

To understand what JavaScript does we need to understand how it relates to HTML and CSS.
